# Bikesharing Investigation
## by Marc Nguyen


## Dataset

> In this investigation, I will be exploring Ford's GoBike bike sharing program in San Francisco, California.  GoBike is a program develop by Ford to provide an alternative means of transportation for getting around town.  You can simply rent a bike to ride around town for leisure or use it as a form of commute to work.<br><br>
I will be using the dataset to paint a picture of what type of customer is using the program and how they are using it.<br>
> The dataset provides information on the bike trip with information on when and where the bike rental starts and stops.  It also provides information the customer with information like age, user type, and gender.


## Summary of Findings

> The main core of the customer base for Ford's GoBike bike sharing program are male Millennials who uses the service on a daily basis.  From the analysis, 69% of bike renters are male, 60% are Millennials, and 85% pay on a subscription basis.
> We know who is using the service.  As for the purpose, the core of the business is for commuting to work.  We could see this by the high usage during Monday to Friday and consistent throughout the week.  We also could see this by the peak usage during peak commute hours of 7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm.
> In the final visualization, I found that the bike sharing service is mainly used during dry warm months of San Francisco, California, with the exception of increase in usage during Christmas shopping period.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> There are several that I had to polish for a better presentation.  All the charts had to be scaled to units of 1k or 100k or easier readability.  For age, I had to group the ages into Age Groups to get a good demographic of age group.  For the days of the week, I changed it to a categorical ordered type to get a straight Monday to Sunday view.  Lastly, for the hour of the day, I changed the hours from military time to am and pm as we are accustomed to.
